current TODOs:

icons for About me
  look at Font Awesome local files for remaining

can I create a more interesting shape with the background instead of using the hard lines? 

contact details
  use form?

image attribution
  struggled for a bit to find a good solution to the attribution problem.
  I got the hover effect to work, but I don't like how it use the space underneath the image
  also this doesn't look good on mobile, which should be the first concern, rather than desktop

past todos:

background color details:
  want to add alternating background effect. 
  could probably set this to be alternating using JS, but want to try with CSS first
  manually setting background color seems ok to start
    background color is interrupted by the body margin
    attribution text looks awkward - not sure why
    solved this!
    I set the background color on the row to get the full background and then a child of that row sets the margin and wraps remaining content
